    <h1>Social Switch: Anonymous Instagram and TikTok</h1>
    <p>
      Redirect Instagram and TikTok URLs to anonymous viewers. Access any profile, posts, tagged posts or stories profile on Instagram or any profile or video on TikTok and the extension will redirect automatically to web viewers.
    </p>
    <p>
      From Instagram URLs to Imginn.com, and from TikTok URLs to Picuki.com.
    </p>
    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p>
      Select a viewer option and enable or disable redirection through the popup.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Instagram post URLs (<i>instagram.com/p/short_code</i>) and Instagram stories profile URLs (<i>instagram.com/stories/handle</i>), regardless of the redirection option, the extension will redirect to Imginn.com.<br>This viewer uses the original post short code, and it has the option to view only stories via URL. However, for tag URLs (<i>instagram.com/explore/tags/tag_name</i>), irrespective of the redirection option, the extension will redirect to Picuki.com, as only this viewer supports tag search.
    </p>
    <h2>Supported URLs</h2>

    <p>
      instagram.com/handle

    <h2>Developer Comments</h2>
    <p>It's necessary to add that despite being anonymous for accessing Instagram and TikTok, the web services Imginn and Picuki are commercial and may track users.<br> For this reason, it is recommended to use these services with VPNs, ad blockers, and other methods to inhibit trackers.</p>

    <p>This extension is not affiliated with Instagram, TikTok, Imginn and Picuki and does not take responsibility for any actions of these web services.</p>
